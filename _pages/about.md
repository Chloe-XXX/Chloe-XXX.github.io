Welcome to my personal website! My name is Ziruo Xiao, and you can call me by any combination of Chloe, Ziruo, and Xiao.

I am an incoming Master's student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, majoring in **Information Networking** (Advanced Study Track), studying computer systems related topics. I obtained my bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** from **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**.

Previously I did 2 software engineering internships at **Google** working in **DBMS-related** groups. I did an interesting bachelor's Final Year Project in [Adversarial Learning & Physics-Informed Neural Network for CFD](https://github.com/DL-for-CFD/alpinn_for_submission). Years earlier I also participated in Information Olympics contests, and I am always a fan of theoretical topics.
