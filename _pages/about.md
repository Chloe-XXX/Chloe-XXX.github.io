Welcome to my personal website! My name is Ziruo Xiao, and you can call me by any combination of Chloe, Ziruo, and Xiao.

I am a Master's student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, majoring in **Information Networking** (Advanced Study Track), studying general software systems related topics with a focus on Databases and Distributed Systems. I am expected to graduate in 2026 Spring. I obtained my bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** from **The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology**.

Previously I did two software engineering internships at **Google** in **database-related infrastructure teams** (GPay Data Platform & Core Data, Indexing Engine). I also have experience in machine learning research (CV+Adversarial Learning, check out my bachelor's [Final Year Project](https://github.com/DL-for-CFD/alpinn_for_submission)). I used to participate in programming contests (OI & ICPC) and have always enjoyed theoretical topics.

I am currently actively seeking internship and project opportunities in software systems, especially related to database/data platforms.
